I'm a PhD student in the Machine Learning for Medical lab. I hold an MSc in Computer Science from EPFL and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. Before joining the lab, I also spent one year as a research assistant at Oracle Labs in Zurich.
