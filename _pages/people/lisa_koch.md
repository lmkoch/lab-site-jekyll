I am an assistant professor for data science in diabetes care at the University of Bern, where I am affiliated with the [University of Bern Clinic for Diabetology, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism (UDEM)](https://udem.insel.ch/en/teaching-and-research/principals-investigators/translate-to-englisch-prof-dr-lisa-koch) and the [Diabetes Center Berne (DCB)](www.dcberne.ch). My long-term goal is to develop certifiably safe, reliable and effective data science tools for patient-specific treatment systems. I have a background in academic research as well as developing data science products for medical devices, with a strong focus on technology that can ultimately benefit patient health in a safe and trustworthy way.


**Bio:** After an undergraduate degree in electrical (BSc) and biomedical engineering (MSc) at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, I did a PhD in machine learning for medical image analysis at Imperial College London, UK. After a post-doc at ETH Zürich I joined the Swiss wearable medical device startup Ava, where I eventually became the data science team lead. In this position, I came to appreciate the need for demonstrably safe machine learning in healthcare. In 2021, I returned to academic research to pursue research on this topic as a group leader for machine learning in medical diagnostics in the Berens lab at the [Hertie Institute for AI in Brain Health](www.hertie.ai) at the University of Tübingen, Germany, where I still hold a part-time appointment.
